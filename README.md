# 🚗 Driver Drowsiness Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a real-time Driver Drowsiness Detection system using Computer Vision techniques.

The system detects the driver's face and eyes using Haar Cascade classifiers. 
If the eyes remain closed for a continuous number of frames, a **DROWSY ALERT** is triggered.

## ⚙️ Working Principle
1. Webcam captures live video.
2. Face is detected using Haar Cascade.
3. Eyes are detected inside the face region.
4. If eyes are not detected for a threshold number of frames → Alert is displayed.
